SVG to Base64 (Web)
==========

Converts an external SVG file to a PNG using base64 by:

- Fetching the SVG and injecting into the page
- Manipulating the SVG
- Converting the SVG to an image and place on canvas
- Convert canvas to a data url and render a PNG using the data url

_Note that this will likely be converted to a more usable and generic example._
